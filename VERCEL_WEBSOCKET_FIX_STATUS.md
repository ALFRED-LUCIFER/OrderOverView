# 🔧 Vercel WebSocket Connection Fix - Status Update

## 🚨 Issue Identified
The Vercel frontend deployment was experiencing "X4: xhr poll error" when trying to connect to the LISA voice interface backend. This was caused by the frontend attempting to connect to `localhost:3001` instead of the production backend URL.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Variable Issue**: The Vercel deployment was not properly using the correct `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL`
2. **Fallback URL Problem**: The frontend was falling back to `localhost:3001` when environment variables weren't set
3. **CORS Configuration**: While our backend CORS was correctly configured, the wrong URL meant it never reached the backend

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Code Fix
**File**: `apps/frontend/src/components/VoiceInterface.tsx`

**Change**: Added intelligent URL detection:
```typescript
// Before
socketRef.current = io(import.meta.env.VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL || 'ws://localhost:3001');

// After  
const wsUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL || 
              (window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app') ? 'wss://orderoverview-dkro.onrender.com' : 'ws://localhost:3001');
console.log('🔌 Connecting to WebSocket:', wsUrl);
socketRef.current = io(wsUrl);
```

### 2. Environment Variable Verification
**Confirmed Configuration**:
- `.env`: ✅ Correct production URLs
- `vercel.json`: ✅ Correct environment variables  
- `.env.production`: ✅ Correct URLs

### 3. CORS Configuration
**Already Properly Configured**:
- Main CORS: ✅ Includes specific Vercel URL
- WebSocket Gateway CORS: ✅ Matches frontend domain
- Regex patterns: ✅ Covers all Vercel deployment variations

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Git Push Completed
- ✅ Code changes committed
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ✅ Vercel auto-deployment triggered

### Expected Timeline
- **Vercel Build**: 2-3 minutes
- **Deployment**: 1-2 minutes  
- **DNS Propagation**: Immediate

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
1. **Direct Backend Connection**: ✅ Should work
2. **Vercel Origin Headers**: ✅ Should work  
3. **LISA Voice Commands**: ✅ Should work

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visit: https://order-over-view-frontend-git-main-soumitras-projects-cad3dd70.vercel.app
- [ ] Open Browser Dev Tools → Console
- [ ] Look for WebSocket connection logs
- [ ] Try LISA voice interface
- [ ] Verify no "X4: xhr poll error" messages

## 🔗 Key URLs

### Production Frontend
```
https://order-over-view-frontend-git-main-soumitras-projects-cad3dd70.vercel.app
```

### Production Backend  
```
https://orderoverview-dkro.onrender.com
```

### WebSocket Endpoint
```
wss://orderoverview-dkro.onrender.com
```

## 📊 Expected Browser Console Output

### Before Fix
```
❌ WebSocket connection error: X4: xhr poll error
```

### After Fix  
```
✅ 🔌 Connecting to WebSocket: wss://orderoverview-dkro.onrender.com
✅ LISA connected with session: [sessionId]
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
1. ✅ No "X4: xhr poll error" in browser console
2. ✅ WebSocket connects to `wss://orderoverview-dkro.onrender.com`
3. ✅ LISA voice interface responds to commands
4. ✅ Browser console shows successful connection logs

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Wait 5 minutes** for Vercel deployment to complete
2. **Test the live site** using the manual checklist above
3. **Report results** - whether the WebSocket errors are resolved
4. **Use LISA voice interface** to verify full functionality

## 🆘 Fallback Plan

If this fix doesn't work, we can:
1. Set environment variables directly in Vercel dashboard
2. Use a different deployment approach
3. Implement additional URL detection logic

**Status**: 🟡 **DEPLOYED - AWAITING VERIFICATION**  
**ETA**: Available for testing in 2-3 minutes  
**Action Required**: Manual testing once deployment completes
