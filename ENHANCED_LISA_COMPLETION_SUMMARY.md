- `apps/frontend/src/components/EnhancedLISAInterface.tsx` ← **NEW**
- `apps/backend/src/voice/voice.controller.ts` ← **Enhanced**
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx` ← **Updated**
- Multiple voice services updated for AI integration

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Backend (.env)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key

# Frontend (.env)
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_ENABLE_VOICE=true
REACT_APP_VOICE_DEBUG=true
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### **1. API Key Configuration**
Set up your AI provider API keys in `apps/backend/.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-key
```

### **2. Start the Application**
```bash
# Backend
cd apps/backend && npm run start:dev

# Frontend
cd apps/frontend && npm run dev
```

### **3. Test Enhanced LISA**
- Navigate to the application
- Use the enhanced LISA interface
